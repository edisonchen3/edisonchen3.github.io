## Abstract
The influence of “regionalism” on literary creation is self-evident. In addition to directly entering the text through regional culture, there is also a hidden thinking influence, which can be largely explained as Jung’s “collective unconsciousness” or a potential inheritance of psychological stereotypes. From this theoretical perspective, when examining the creation of Chaoshan online literature, it can be found that there are different dimensions of Chaoshan cultural spirit hidden in their works. These cultural spirits not only constitute the cultural heritage and cultural thinking of Chaoshan's online literature, but also actively respond to the value advocacy of the Central Committee of the CPC for "cultural confidence" and the practical demand for "telling Chinese stories well".


## Key words
regionality, psychological stereotyping, Chaoshan cultural spirit, Chaoshan online , literature creation
