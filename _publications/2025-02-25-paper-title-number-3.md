## Abstract
Female characters occupy a crucial position in The Three Body Problem series. The mature “social network analysis” method from the field of digital humanities plays a vital role in constructing and analyzing the character relationship network in the text， revealing the central role these female characters occupy in the novel’s social structure. Ye Wenjie， having experienced repeated betrayals of trust， distances herself from human society and chooses to trust the Trisolarans. In stark contrast， Cheng Xin makes a drastically different decision. Meanwhile， characters like Zhizi and others present varying trust models and political metaphors through their actions. From the feminist perspective， these female characters gradually break free from the constraints of the traditional patriarchal social structure， achieving a rebellion against patriarchy in the future society. This is manifested in their acquisition of the discourse power within the social network's resources. This transformation not only highlights the multifaceted identities of female characters in the novel but also reflects a profound reflection on gender politics and social structure.
