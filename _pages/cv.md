Research Experience
======
* 2023.12-Present: Research Participant
 * The major project of National Social Science Foundation: Compilation, Research and Database Construction of Chinese Literary Supplement Literature (1898-1949)
 * My specific contribution involved independently performing the manual digitization of the complete catalog of the Xin Yuandi literary supplement from the Nanjing Xinmin Daily (1935-1937, totaling 389 issues). I then established an Excel database, meticulously detailing information such as authors, genres, themes, and special issues. This effort significantly filled an academic gap, as this particular literary supplement’s content had not been previously cataloged, thus providing a crucial case study for the project’s foundational literature database.
* 2023.10-2025.06: Research Participant
 * The 2022 Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund project: Research on cross-media narration and communication effects of Chinese network literature from the perspective of gender research
 * Within this project, I was responsible for constructing a multi-dimensional database of character relationships within The Three-Body Problem. Using Python and Gephi, I performed social network centrality calculations and visualized the data. This allowed me to demonstrate the pivotal position of female characters within the work’s social network through metrics such as betweenness centrality and weighted degree. Furthermore, I interpreted the behaviors of key characters like Ye Wenjie and Cheng Xin, integrating Luo Jiade’s theory of “trust mechanisms” into my analysis.
* 2024.06-2025.06: Project Applicants and First Completers
 * The 2024 Shantou Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project: “New Southern Writing” and Contemporary Chaoshan Young Writers Studies
 * I established a creative archives database featuring representative writers under 45, including Chen Chongzheng, Lin Zhao, Chen Qiufan, and Huang Shoutan. This involved compiling their biographies, work lists, awards, and critical reviews, culminating in the "Basic Information Compendium of Chaoshan Young Writers." Furthermore, by incorporating concepts from "literary geography" and "liminality theory," along with Stephen King's insights into regional writing, I delved into the profound influence of Chaoshan's overseas Chinese culture, clan traditions, and Wu-nuo folk beliefs on these writers.
* 2023.09-2024.12: Research Participant
 * The construction and cultivation project of Digital Humanities at Shantou University: “Database consumption” and “Character setting” in network literature
 * I leveraged tools like Gephi to conduct a social network analysis of the core character designs (renshe) in popular works on online literature platforms such as Jinjiang and Qidian. This involved quantitatively analyzing the correlation between these character designs and story complexity, emotional tone, and reader interaction data. Based on these data visualization results and textual case studies, I successfully completed the writing of the final project report.
* 2023.09-2024.09: Research Participant
 * The general project of philosophy and social science planning of Guangdong Province: Research on the creation, development, dissemination and database construction of Guangdong network literature
 * I focused on data collection and organization, which included compiling author profiles, literary texts, and critical reviews. I systematically organized representative works by internet writers from the Chaoshan region, such as A Bo, Jiayu Bushi Gui, and Jing Jiangxiao. This process led to the creation of a typical case study database, providing empirical support for research into the unique regional characteristics of Guangdong’s online literature.
* 2023.12-2024.06: Research Participant
 * The 2023 Shantou Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project: Research on the Creation, Dissemination and Database Construction of Chaoshan Network Literature
 * I categorized and organized the creative journeys, work lists, and market reception of over ten representative authors, including A Bo, Yu Fang, and Lian Jue, based on "male-frequency" and "female-frequency" genres, thereby constructing a comprehensive author archives database. My research specifically honed in on critical issues such as "work homogenization" and "lagging IP development." Through a combination of statistical data analysis and in-depth interviews, I quantitatively assessed the shortcomings of Chaoshan online literature in terms of genre innovation and market competitiveness.
